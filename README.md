- LYM: Lymphocytes are a type of white blood cell which also have an elevated count during times of infection. Normal Lymphocte count ranges from 800-5000 (0.8-5.0) lymphocy

- CD3+CD4+ : These also represent the number of C3 & C4 T-cells. And are indicative of immune system response.

- CD3*T : CD3 (cluster of differentiation 3) is a protein complex and T cell co-receptor that is involved in activating both the cytotoxic T cell . These are indicative of immune system response towards an infection.

- CD3+CD8+ : These also represent the number of C3 & C8 T-cells. And are indicative of immune system response.

- CD4/CD8 Ratio : This ratio of CD4 & CD8 cells tells about how strong a persons immune system is.  Ratio higher than 2 indicates a healthy immune system and ratio lower than 1 otherwise.

- CRP(mg/L) : It stands for C-Reactive Protein & is indicative of inflammation in the body. Levels less than 10mg/L are normal while greater than 10mg/L indicate serious infection.

- PCT, ng/mL : Procalcitonin levels are used for diagnosis of bacterial sepsis. High PCT levels are found in patients with severe sepsis and septic shock. The elevated as well as highly elevated level of PCT (>2 ng/mL or >10 ng/mL, respectively)

- pCO2, mm Hg : It indicates partial pressure of CO2 in blood . It is an indicator of respiratory function . Its normal values are in the range 35–45 mmHg.

- pO2, mm Hg : It indicates partial pressure of O2 in blood . It primarily measures the effectiveness of the lungs in pulling oxygen into the blood stream from the atmosphere. Its normal values range from 80-100 mm Hg.
- sO2(%): It indicates the extent to which oxygen saturates the hemoglobin molecules in the RBC's . The normal value ranges from 95-100%.
- sO2(%): It indicates the extent to which oxygen saturates the hemoglobin molecules in the RBC's .
- LDH, U/L : LDH stands for Lactic Acid Dehydrogenase . It is produced during breakage of tissue hence is a indicator of injuries and diseases . Normal LDH levels are between 140 to 280 U/L
- D‐D, ug/mL : D-dimer levels in blood are indicative of hyperfibrinolysis . Elevated levels can be associated to pulmonary diseases and sepsis. Normal range is less than 0.50 ug/mL
- Fib , g/L : Fibriogen level indicates how well it  functions in helping to form a blood clot . Normal fibriogen levels are 200-400 mg/dL.
- FOB : Faecal occult blood . This test check for the presence of blood in the faeces of the patient.
- SARS‐CoV‐2 (P/N) : This indicates the result of a Rapid PCR test for the presence of SARS-CoV-2 viral strain.
